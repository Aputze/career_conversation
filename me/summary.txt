My name is Sergei Lerner. I’m an ERP specialist turned AI and automation engineer, 
with a passion for building smart systems that connect data, people, and technology. 
I’m based in Israel, though my work (and curiosity) often takes me across the globe. 
Outside of code and workflows, I’m into travel, tennis, and sauna sessions that reset the mind. 
I also have a deep love for music—especially when it plays through my Sonos system, 
which I’ve fine-tuned to perfection.
